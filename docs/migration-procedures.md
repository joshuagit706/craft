# Template Version Migration Procedures

This document outlines the standard procedures for migrating existing deployments to new template versions within the CRAFT platform, and for promoting Soroban contracts from testnet to mainnet.

## Overview

Template version migrations ensure that existing deployments can benefit from new features, security updates, and performance improvements without breaking their current functionality or losing customization data.

## Migration Workflow

### 1. Preparation and Snapshotting
Before initiating a migration, the system must take a snapshot of the current deployment state:
- Capture the current `customization_config`.
- Record the current `repository_url` and commit hash.
- Store the current Vercel deployment ID.

### 2. Compatibility Validation
The `TemplateMigrationService` verifies if the current configuration is compatible with the target template version.
- Check for required fields in the new version.
- Validate that all enabled features in the old version are still supported or mapped correctly.

### 3. Schema Migration (If Applicable)
If the new template version requires changes to the database schema (e.g., Supabase tables), these migrations are applied first.
- Migrations must be idempotent.
- Rollback scripts must be available.

### 4. Code Regeneration
The `TemplateGeneratorService` regenerates the workspace code using:
- The new template version as the base.
- The preserved `customization_config` from the snapshot.

### 5. Repository Update
The regenerated code is pushed to the user's repository:
- Use a new branch (e.g., `upgrade/v2.0.0`) for safety.
- Perform a dry run or automated testing if possible.

### 6. Deployment and Health Check
The platform triggers a redeployment (e.g., on Vercel):
- Monitor deployment logs for errors.
- Verify the new deployment URL returns a 200 OK status.

### 7. Finalization and Notification
Once the health check passes:
- Update the deployment record with the new template version.
- Send a notification to the user about the successful upgrade.

## Rollback Procedures

If any step in the migration workflow fails:
1. **Repository Rollback**: Revert the repository to the previous known good commit hash.
2. **State Restoration**: Restore the deployment record in Supabase using the snapshot taken in Step 1.
3. **Notification**: Inform the user of the failed migration and the reason for the rollback.

## Best Practices

- **Test with Real Data**: Always test migrations using a copy of real deployment data.
- **Backward Compatibility**: New template versions should aim to be backward compatible with previous configurations.
- **Minimal Downtime**: Aim for zero-downtime migrations by leveraging Vercel's deployment previews.

## Database Backup and Point-in-Time Recovery

CRAFT uses Supabase PITR to ensure any failed migration can be fully reversed without data loss.

### Before Running a Schema Migration

1. Note the current time (UTC) — this is your restore target if the migration fails.
2. Verify PITR is enabled: Supabase Dashboard → **Project Settings → Database → Backups**.
3. Confirm the WAL archiving lag is < 1 minute before starting.

### Recovery Point After a Failed Migration

If a schema migration corrupts data or breaks the application:

1. Follow the full recovery procedure in **[docs/backup-recovery-runbook.md](./backup-recovery-runbook.md)**.
2. Restore to the timestamp noted in step 1 above (before the migration ran).
3. Re-apply only the migrations that were known-good before the failure.

### Idempotency Requirement

All Supabase migration files under `supabase/migrations/` must use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF EXISTS` guards so that replaying migrations up to any PITR restore point is safe.  The automated tests in `supabase/tests/backup/recovery.test.ts` enforce this property.

### Recovery Time and Point Objectives

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | < 30 minutes |
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | < 1 minute (WAL granularity) |
| PITR retention (Pro) | 7 days |
| PITR retention (Enterprise) | 30 days |
